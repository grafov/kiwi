#+TODO: WIP(s) STOPPED(p) | DONE(d) CANCELED(c@)
* For realization
** DONE check that loggers works ok without any output
   случай неправильного порядка инита
   или закрытие всех имеющихся выводов
** DONE check artifical output names, use writers for distinction
   переименовать getoutput в getwriter?
** DONE custom formatters
** DONE add encoding.TextMarshaller
** DONE fix odd args logic: odd key showed as is without a value
** DONE add time.Time into convertors
** DONE move benchmarks to a separate package
** DONE global logger										:roadmap:
** STOPPED mode: drop duplicate records in an output
** DONE start any sink paused
   It will help set filters before the sink got a lot of log messages and passes them by default.
** DONE clarify logic of sanitation for quoted keys and quoted values	:bug:
** DONE add tests for output filters								:roadmap:
** DONE clarify logic of odd keys
   maybe treat them as values?
** WIP add tests for logger add/log for different input types
** add tests for formatters
** add tests for logger context
** add tests for logger timestamps
** move examples from README to example_ functions then add single short usage example to README
** colour format for the console (formatter or decorator)			:roadmap:
** log write throttling mode										:roadmap:
** ability to use custom filters									:roadmap:
** demo application
** research solutions for multiline logging especially for go traces in other loggers
** add more predefined filters for stdlib types (string, time.Time) :roadmap:
* Ideas
** move typed helpers into a separated package or
** remove typed helpers - it seems as preferable way as it make API shorter
   Test results shows not many benefit from them. Need more tests.
** decorators for formatters

Package kiwi is a library with an odd logic that log your application' data in its own strange way.

WIP. API and features is subject of changes. Use it carefully!

Features briefly:

 * simple format with explicit key for each log message (*logfmt* like) - for high readability by humans

 * JSON format that so liked by machines

 * ability to define own custom format of the output

 * there are not nailed levels, not hardcoded fields in the format

 * output dynamic filtering (change log verbosity on the fly)

 * can keep context of application

 * it fast enough and careful about memory allocs

Key feature of `kiwi` logger is dynamic filtering of incoming records.
Instead of checking severety level for decide about pass or not the record to the output,
`kiwi` passes all records to *all* the outputs (they called *sinks* in `kiwi` terminology).
But before actual writing each record checked with a set of filters.
Each sink has its own filter set.
It takes into account record keys, values, ranges of values.
So each sink decides pass the record to a writer or filter it out.
Also any pairs in the record may be hidden: so different sinks may display different parts of the same record.
Other effect is: any record may be written to any number of outputs.
